        Displays simulated test on visualizer

- bool:
    name: run_sim_in_realtime
    value: false
    description: >-
        Runs simulation in realtime, useful to look at simulated C++ tests in thunderscope
        without running ThreadedFullsystemGUI

- bool:
    name: stop_ai_on_start
    value: false
    description: >-
        If enable_visualizer is true, then stops the AI when the test starts

        The directory to output logs to. Absolute paths are recommended as the working directory
        is inside the bazel-out directory.

- double:
    name: test_speed
    value: 1.0
    min: 0.1
    max: 10.0
    description: >-
        The speed adjustment factor. Values in the range [0.1, 1) will play the test slower than realtime,
        and values in the range (1, 10] will play the test faster than realtime i.e. 0.1 would be 10X slower
        than realtime, and 10 would be 10X faster than realtime. Default value is 1.
