         The weight that being close to the goal will have on the static
         position quality. Lower, more negative weights result in the distance
         to the goal having less of an effect.

                The maximum angle that we have to rotate after receiving a pass to
                shoot that we think would likely result in a goal. Note that we may
                try to take shots that require us to rotate more then this, it's more
                of a soft limit.
