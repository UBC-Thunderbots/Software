/**
 * The world object describes the entire state of the world, which for us is all the
 * information we have about the field, robots, and ball. The world object acts as a
 * convenient way to pass all this information around to modules that may need it.
 *
 * WARNING: This class should _never_ hold any data that is pointed to anywhere else. This
 * means no raw pointers, no shared pointers, no shared references. This is because in
 * some cases we copy World's over multiple threads where having a shared member
 * between multiple instances of a World on multiple threads could result in
 * data corruption that would lead to absurdly hard to track bugs. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
