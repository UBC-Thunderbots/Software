Translates concise versions of test suites into C programs
suitable suitable for use with the Check unit test framework.

See the source code in checkmk.in (checkmk when installed) for terms of
distribution (scaled-down version of the modified BSD license).

To see how it works, try running checkmk on the example files,
basic_complete.ts and multiple_everything.ts:
  checkmk basic_complete.ts > basic_complete.c
  cc -o basic basic_complete.c -lcheck
  ./basic
