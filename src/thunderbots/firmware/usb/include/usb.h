	 * USB requires that a single GET DESCRIPTOR request return a block of data starting with a configuration descriptor and containing, following it, a mixture of interface, endpoint, and other descriptors, with \ref usb_configuration_descriptor_t::wTotalLength "wTotalLength" indicating the length of that block.
	 * This pointer must point at such a block in memory.
	 * A typical method for an application to construct such a block is to define a struct type containing the descriptors in order, marked with <code>__attribute__((packed))</code>, and define a constant instance of that struct type stored in Flash with the descriptors filled in appropriately.
	 * The following example shows how this might be done:
	 *
	 * \code
	 * const struct __attribute__((packed)) {
	 * 	usb_configuration_descriptor_t config;
	 * 	usb_interface_descriptor_t intf0;
	 * 	usb_endpoint_descriptor_t ep1i;
	 * } CONFIG_DESCRIPTOR = {
	 * 	.config = {
	 * 		.bLength = sizeof(usb_configuration_descriptor_t),
	 * 		.bDescriptorType = USB_DTYPE_CONFIGURATION,
	 * 		.wTotalLength = sizeof(CONFIG_DESCRIPTOR),
	 * 		.bNumInterfaces = 1,
	 * 		…
	 * 	},
	 *
	 * 	.intf0 = {
	 * 		.bLength = sizeof(usb_interface_descriptor_t),
	 * 		.bDescriptorType = USB_DTYPE_INTERFACE,
	 * 		.bInterfaceNumber = 0,
	 * 		.bAlternateSetting = 0,
	 * 		…
	 * 	},
	 *
	 * 	.ep1i = {
	 * 		.bLength = sizeof(usb_endpoint_descriptor_t),
	 * 		.bDescriptorType = USB_DTYPE_ENDPOINT,
	 * 		.bEndpointAddress = 0x81,
	 * 		…
	 * 	},
	 * };
	 * \endcode
	 *
	 * This field could then be initialized to \c &CONFIG_DESCRIPTOR.config.

	/**
	 * \brief The sizes of the nonzero endpoint transmit FIFOs, in words.
	 *
	 * Each transmit FIFO must be at least large enough to hold one full packet for the endpoint; larger FIFOs will improve performance, though it is never useful to allocate more than seven packets’ worth of FIFO space for an endpoint.
	 *
	 * In all cases, at least 16 words will be allocated to each FIFO due to hardware requirements.
	 * If the relevant entry in this array is less than 16, it will be ignored and 16 words will be allocated.
	 *
	 * The USB stack allocates a fixed amount of space to each transmit FIFO for the lifetime of a configuration.
	 * Reallocating space from one FIFO to another between alternate settings is not possible.
	 *
	 * In some cases, the USB stack may set a FIFO smaller than specified here, as a mechanism to reduce the frequency of interrupts.
	 * If this occurs, there will be unused spaces between different endpoints’ FIFOs; these are harmless.
	 *
	 * Element zero of this array corresponds to IN endpoint one.
	 *
	 * \internal
	 *
	 * Allocating a smaller-than-requested FIFO stems from the fact that the hardware requires that the FIFO contain no more than seven packets at a time.
	 * Fortunately, when seven packets are in the FIFO, the FIFO reports as completely full and the half-empty interrupt is deasserted, even if not all words are filled.
	 * If the FIFO is at least 14 packets long, the half-empty interrupt will trigger as soon as a single packet has left the FIFO, because it will then be half-empty.
	 * This means that an interrupt will be taken on every packet, which is inefficient.
	 * Reducing the FIFO size ensures that even when the FIFO is non-full packet-wise, it will still be more than half full word-wise.
	 * Thus, interrupts will be amortized down to the point where the FIFO becomes half empty word-wise.
	 *
	 * Because the FIFO must be at least 16 words deep, this optimization is impossible to apply for maximum packet sizes of 8 bytes or smaller, and has only modest benefit until larger packet sizes are reached.
