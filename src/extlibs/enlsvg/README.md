# Enlsvg-Pathfinding
This is an implementation of the Edge N-Level Sparse Visibility Graph algorithm for extremely fast optimal Any-Angle Pathfinding on grid maps. (on the order of a millisecond per path computation on 6000x6000 grids)

The Enlsvg algorithm requires a pre-processing step, which may take some time, depending on the size of the grid map.

More information on the algorithm can be found here:
