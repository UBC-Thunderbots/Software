# The Simulator from Roboterfußballmannschaft der Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg Robotics Erlangen's SSL-Team ER-Force's Framework

The simulator is adapted from [robotics-erlangen/framework](https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework). It contains several bug fixes and general code quality improvements, and it is modified so that time steps can be controlled by a `stepSimulation` function.
