# The Simulator from Roboterfußballmannschaft der Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg Robotics Erlangen's SSL-Team ER-Force's Framework
The simulator was adapted from [robotics-erlangen/framework](https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework). It was modified so that time steps could be controlled by a stepSimulation function.
