     *                         of "off the end" of the spline. ie. this vector is
     *                         "symmetric" with `start_vector`

     *
     * The direction of the start and end vectors determine the direction of the curve at
     * the start and end points. The magnitude of these vectors determine how far the
     * curve is stretched in the direction of the vector before connecting with the
