#error This is an extra check to make sure that we are never including this in another  \
     header file. If we do so then all of boost geometry may recursively be included \
     in significant other sections of the codebase, seriously slowing down compilation \
     times. To let this check pass, please confirm that you are *not* including this  \
     in another header file by adding \
     '#define POINT_BOOST_COMPATABILITY_THIS_IS_NOT_IN_A_HEADER' before the \
     inclusion of this file
