     * Creates a new SimulatorBackend
     *
     * The SimulatorBackend will run a physics simulation to simulate and publish the
     * World, and simulate the primitives given to it. The SimulatorBackend is
     * deterministic and so will advance the simulation by a fixed amount each time
     * primitives are received, rather than running completely independently at full-speed
     * or in real-time.
     *
     * The reason we don't want to run in real-time is because the simulation can likely
     * run much faster than real life. This is a problem because if the simulation can run
     * at 300Hz (for example), but the AI can only run at 30Hz, the buffers between the
     * Observers will overflow and data will be lost. This is not realistic because
     * generally the input runs at 60Hz (roughly the same rate as the camera fps) and the
     * AI runs at about 30Hz.
     *
     * This means that in real life each time the AI is ready for more data, about 2 *
     * 1/60 seconds have passed in real-time (and therefore World time). But if the
     * simulation is running way faster then 10 * 1/60 seconds will have passed each time
     * the AI is ready for more data. This is the scenario we are trying to avoid by
     * waiting for Primitives before continuing the simulation.
     *
