/**
 * The PhysicsSimulator handles the physics simulation of 'World' objects, and abstracts
 * away dealing with the physics engine and our PhysicsObject abstraction
 * in the world.
 *
 * The simulation uses Box2D as the physics engine, and the abstractions can be found
 * in the `simulation` folder. For more information and examples of how to use Box2D
 * see the following:
 * - https://box2d.org/documentation/
 * - https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Box2d
 * - https://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/
 *
 * Why do the PhysicsObject classes use raw pointers?
 *
 * Basically, b2Body objects should only be destroyed by the b2World. The b2Body
 * destructor is marked private to force this to happen. See
 * https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D/blob/master/Box2D/Dynamics/b2Body.h and
 * https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D/blob/master/Box2D/Dynamics/b2Body.cpp
 *
 * This means we can't create smart pointers from the b2Body* returned when we create a
 * body like std::shared_ptr<b2Body>(world->CreateBody(&body_def)). This fails because
 * the smart pointer template will try make a call to the private destructor. Ultimately
 * this is why we have to use raw pointers in these cases.
