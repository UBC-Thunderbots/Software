 * Because our firmware structs rely on C-style function pointers, we
 * cannot use C++ constructs like std::function to provide to the structs.
 * Therefore we use this class's static functions to provide the function
 * pointers, since static functions work as C-style function pointers
 * (because there is no instance associated with them).
 *
 * Whenever a caller needs to get a firmware struct or perform an operation, they
 * need to set which ball they want to control so that all the static functions
 * that have been provided to the firmware struct operate on the correct
 * instantiated object. This is our workaround to maintain and simulate multiple
 * "instances" of firmware at once.
