/*
 * Broadcasts and listens to protobuf msgs through specified TransferMedium. This class is
 * templated to specify which msg types to send and receive. Any msgs that are received
 * that do not match that type will be dropped.
 *
 * This class takes a TransferMedium as a dependency which indicates how the msg is to be
 * transfered to the Robot (over SPI, UART, ETHERNET, ...)
 *
 * On construction, two thread-safe buffers will be started and a connection will be
 * established. Msgs will be processed until this class is destroyed.
 *
 * NOTE: All receiving is done asynchronously.
