/**
 * A simple Timestamp class built around doubles. This Timestamp is intended to represent
 * the t_capture timestamps we receive from the SSL Vision system. These t_capture values
 * are monotonic (meaning they are always positive and always increase), and are relative
 * to the "epoch time" defined by SSL Vision. This "epoch" is when SSL Vision starts up
 * and begins streaming data. Therefore, these timestamps are not absolute "wall clock"
 * time, but points in time relative to when the SSL Vision program started. They can and
 * should be used to timestamp all data received from SSL Vision and propagated throughout
 * the system in order to calculate time differences (durations), velocities, and other
 * time-dependent values.
