 * AngularVelocities, which makes the interfaces more intuitive.
 * TODO (#3093): Not all methods of Angle class make sense for AngularVelocity!
 *  E.g. Angle::clamp does not make sense in the context of AngularVelocity, as 360 deg/s
 *  is different from 0 deg/s, but 360 deg is the same as 0 deg.
