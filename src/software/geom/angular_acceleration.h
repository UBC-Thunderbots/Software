 * AngularAcceleration, which makes the interfaces more intuitive.
 * TODO (#3093): Not all methods of Angle class make sense for AngularAcceleration!
 *  E.g. Angle::clamp does not make sense in the context of AngularAcceleration, as
 *  360 deg/s^2 is different from 0 deg/s^2, but 360 deg is the same as 0 deg.
