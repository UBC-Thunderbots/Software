/**
 * A DynamicPlay is a Play that assigns tactics based on scoring functions
 * whose parameters and outputs are incrementally adjusted over time based
 * on the Play's success. This enables the Play to "learn" which tactics are
 * most effective for a given gameplay scenario.
 *
 * Every time we select and run the DynamicPlay, we call it an iteration of the play.
 * At the start of each iteration, the DynamicPlay chooses which support tactics
 * to run and commits to those tactics for the length of the iteration.
 * When the iteration ends, the DynamicPlay's performance over the iteration
 * is evaluated, and the assessment is used to either encourage or discourage
 * selection of the iteration's chosen support tactics in future iterations.
