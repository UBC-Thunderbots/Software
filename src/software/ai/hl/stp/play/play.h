/**
 * In the STP framework, a Play is a collection of tactics that represent some
 * "team-wide" goal. It can be thought of like a traditional play in soccer.
 * Some examples are:
 * - A defense play
 * - An offense play
 * - A corner-kick of free-kick play
 *
 * Plays are stateful, and use Tactics to implement their behaviour.
 * For the most part, this statefulness is used to created "stages" for each Play.
 * For example, a corner-kick play be broken down into 2 stages:
 * - First, get the robots into position and find a good robot to pass to
 * - Execute the pass and attempt a one-touch shot on net
 *
 * These stages are useful in order for us to create more complex behaviour and write
 * it in a more understandable way.
