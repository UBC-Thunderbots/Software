/**
 * In the STP framework, a Tactic represents a role or objective for a single robot.
 * This can be thought of as a "position" on a typical soccer team. Some examples are:
 * - The goalie
 * - A "striker" that tries to get the ball and shoot on the enemy goal
 * - A defender that shadows enemy robots
 * - A passer
 * - A receiver (for a pass)
 *
 * Tactics are stateful, and use Intents to implement their behaviour. They also
 * make heavy use of our Evaluation functions in order to help them make decisions.
