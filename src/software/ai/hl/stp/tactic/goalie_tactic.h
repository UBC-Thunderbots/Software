/**
 * This tactic is used to defend the ball from going into the goal. The tactic
 * is assigned to the robot that is selected using a DynamicParameter, and stays
 * that way throughout all the plays that require a goalie.
 *
 * If the ball is moving faster than a threshold torwards the net, moves to intercept
 * the ball. If not, returns intents that position the robot in a cone between the ball
 * and the two goal posts, in such a way that the robot would have to move a minimal
 * distance either way to intercept a potential straight shot into the net.
