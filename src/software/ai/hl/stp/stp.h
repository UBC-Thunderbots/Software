/**
 * The STP module is an implementation of the high-level logic Abstract class, that
 * uses the STP (Skills, Tactics, Plays) framework for its decision making.
 *
 * See play.h and tactic.h for more specific documentation on
 * each component.
 *
 * Explaining ControlParams
 * - ControlParams are any parameters that are related to gameplay logic.
 *   Some examples are:
 *   - The EnemyThreat datastructure
 *   - A Pass datastructure
 *   - A position on the field
 *   - How far to chip the ball
 *   These parameters can NOT be automatically updated because they are specific
 *   to the Play or Tactic that is providing them. Therefore, Plays update the
 *   ControlParams of Tactics. These are the parameters that actually change their
 *   behaviour.
 * - NOTE: In the high-level overview below, the ControlParams
 *   for the Tactics are updated before the Tactics are run, so all
 *   necessary information is provided before gameplay decisions are made.
 *
 * STP's main job is to decide what each robot should be doing at any point
 * in time (ie. what Intent each robot should be running). When STP is given
 * a new World and asked for Intents, it goes through the following steps:
 *
 * 1. Decide what Play should be running at this time. If the play is done then
 *    it is restarted.
 *
 * 2. Run the current Play to get the Tactics should be run at this time.
 *    This will update the ControlParams for the tactics.
 *    NOTE: At this time no particular robot is assigned to run any particular tactic.
 *    We just know WHAT tactics should be run, not what robot is running them.
 *
 * 3. Assign robots to tactics. Tactics assign a "cost" to each robot based on internal
 *    criteria, and then we attempt to assign robots in such a way that minimizes the
 *    global cost.
 *
 * 4. Run each tactic to get the Intent that each robot should run.
 *
 * 5. Return this list of Intents

    /**
     * Given a vector of vector of tactics and the current World, assigns robots
     * from the friendly team to each tactic
     *
     * Some tactics may not be assigned a robot, depending on if there is a robot
     * capable of performing that tactic
     *
     * This will clear all assigned robots from all tactics
     *
     * The outer vector ranks the inner vector of tactics by priority. Tactics in
     * lower indexes of the outer vector will be assigned first. For example:
     *
     * {
     *      {crease_defender_1, crease_defender_2},
     *      {move_tactic},
     * }
     *
     * The cost of assigning both the crease_defender tactics will be minimized across
     * all robots first, followed by the move_tactic.
     *
     * The order of the given tactics in the inner vector also determines their priority,
     * with the tactics at the beginning of the vector being a higher priority than those
     * at the end. The priority determines which tactics will NOT be assigned if there are
     * not enough robots on the field to assign them all. For example, if a Play returned
     * 4 Tactics in total but there were only 3 robots on the field at the time, only the
     * first 3 Tactics in the vectors would be assigned to robots and run. (In the example
     * above, only the goalie and crease_defenders would be assigned)
     *
