/**
 * The Action class is the lowest level of abstraction in our STP architecture.
 * Actions are stateful, and represent simple Actions any robot can perform.
 * Examples of this are
 * - Moving to a position (without colliding with anything)
 * - Shooting / kicking at a target
 * - Intercepting / catching the ball
 *
 * Actions use Intents to implement their behaviour. Actions are different than
 * Intents because Intents are not stateful, and generally do not check if their
 * preconditions are met when they are run. Actions are responsible for making sure
 * any preconditions of an Intent are met before running it, which is where the
 * statefulness comes into play. For example, an Action may need to move a robot
 * into the correct position / alignment before shooting.
