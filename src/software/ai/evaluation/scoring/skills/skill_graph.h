/**
 * SkillGraph is used to produce sequences of Skills to execute based on the past
 * success of sequences generated.
 *
 * It is a weighted directed graph containing a node for every Skill, with each node
 * connected to every other node. Edge weights represent the success of a transition
 * from one Skill to the next.
 *
 * The SkillGraph records the current sequence of Skills as a walk through the graph.
 * It extends the sequence by picking the most successful and viable Skill to
 * transition to from the last executed Skill in the sequence. The current sequence
 * can then be completed and scored based on the success of the Skills executed;
 * this will adjust the weights of the edges traversed over in the sequence, enabling
 * the SkillGraph to learn and remember which Skill transitions worked well or not.
