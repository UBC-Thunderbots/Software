/**
 * This class is responsible for generating passes for us to perform
 *
 * == General Description ==
 * It is built such that when it is constructed, a thread is immediately started in
 * the background continuously optimizing/pruning/re-generating passes. As such, any
 * modifications to data in this class through a public interface *must* be managed
 * by mutexes. Generally in functions that touch data we use "std::scoped_lock" to
 * take ownership of the mutex protecting data for the duration of the function.
 *
 * == Making Changes/Additions ==
 * Whenever you change/add a function, you need to ask: "what data is this _directly_
 * touching?". If the function is touching anything internal to the class, you should
 * be getting a lock on the pass_generator_mutex for the duration of the
 * function (see below for examples). Note the *directly* bit! If you are
 * changing/adding function "A", and you have it call function "B", if B touches
 * data, then B should be responsible for getting a lock on the data. If you acquire
 * a lock in A, then call B, which also requires a lock, then the threads will
 * deadlock and everything will grind to a halt.
 *
 * == Performance Considerations ==
 * It is important that the pass generator is able to "keep up" with the current
 * time. This is because a pass is defined in part by it's start time. If the
 * pass generator only completes an iteration of pass updates once every 5 seconds,
 * then the start times for the passes will be in the past (if we choose to pass
 * very soon when optimizing the pass), and so the passes will likely be invalid by
 * the time another iteration starts. Because of this, it is extremely important that
 * the pass generator runs fast enough. Debug builds running on slightly slower
 * computers could be unable to converge. It is recommended that all testing of things
 * involving the PassGenerator be done with executables built in "Release" in order to
 * maximize performance ("Release" can be 2-10x faster then "Debug").
