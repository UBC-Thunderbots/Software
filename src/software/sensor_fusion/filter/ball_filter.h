/**
 * Given ball data from SSL Vision, filters and returns the position/velocity of the
 * "real" ball.
 *
 * This ball filter stores a buffer of previous SSL Vision detections, and uses linear
 * regression to find the path the ball is travelling on and estimate its position
 * and velocity. This buffer/regression system was chosen because it results in a
 * very stable output, particularly for the ball velocity. The data we receive isn't
 * perfect (which is why we have a filter). If we receive a noisy position that is off
 * the ball's current trajectory, it will have minimal impact. This means that as
 * the ball is travelling, this filter will return a very steady velocity vector.
 * This is important because small deviations in velocity orientation can have large
 * effects when the AI tries to predict the future position of the ball. For example,
 * consistently receiving a pass relies on the ball's velocity being very stable,
 * otherwise the robot would "jiggle" back and forth as the estimated receiver position
 * would keep changing.
