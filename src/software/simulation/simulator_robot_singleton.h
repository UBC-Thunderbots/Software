/**
 * This class acts as a wrapper around a SimulatorRobot so that the SimulatorRobot
 * can provide the interface of a FirmwareRobot.
 *
 * Because our firmware structs rely on C-style function pointers, we
 * cannot use C++ constructs like std::function to provide to the structs.
 * Therefore we use this class's static functions to provide the function
 * pointers, since static functions work as C-style function pointers
 * (because there is no instance associated with them).
 *
 * Whenever a caller needs to get a firmware struct or perform an operation, they
 * need to set which robot they want to control so that all the static functions
 * that have been provided to the firmware struct operate on the correct
 * instantiated object. This is our workaround to maintain and simulate multiple
 * "instances" of robot firmware at once.

     * in real-world coordinates, it's position will be reported as (-1, 2) if
     * the negative field side is specified. On the other hand if the positive
     * field side is specified, the robot's position will be reported as (1, -2).
     *
     * This different behaviour for either field side exists because our firmware
     * expects its knowledge of the world to math our coordinate convention, which is
     * relative to the side of the field the robot is defending. See
     * https://github.com/UBC-Thunderbots/Software/blob/master/docs/software-architecture-and-design.md#coordinates
