/**
 * \defgroup TBUF Triple Buffer Management Functions
 *
 * These functions provide management of triple buffers used in producer-consumer relationships.
 * A triple buffer provides the following semantics:
 * \li Given exactly one producer, the producer can always, without blocking, find a buffer into which to produce a new element.
 * \li Given exactly one consumer, the consumer can always, without blocking, find a buffer containing a completed element.
 * \li The buffer found by the consumer is always the most recent buffer submitted as complete by the producer.
 *
 * This module provides the control-plane functionality for deciding which buffer should be used by which task when.
 * The actual data buffers must be provided by the applicationâ€”there must be three buffers, indexed from 0 to 2.
