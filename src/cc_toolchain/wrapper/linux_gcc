# We need to wrap gcc because we need to insert the following flag:
# we put the `-Wl,--no-as-needed` flag here because it needs to be put before
# the -l[target] dependencies for correct linking. Without it, gcc will 
# only link in the direct dependencies for each shared lib, but because 
# bazel delays linking to the end of the build, this means some (non-direct) 
# dependencies of the final target will not be linked in
