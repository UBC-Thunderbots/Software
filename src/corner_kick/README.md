## How to use

You can start the visualizer by running:

```
roslaunch corner_kick corner_kick.launch
```

## Contribute

### Running the dev server

You can test your code by running:

```
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
```

and in another window:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

A window should open with the application in development mode.

## Project Structure

The project is defined as follow:

-   `config` - contains webpack (build tool) configuration files
-   `launch` - contains roslaunch file
-   `src`
    -   `assets` - contains image assets
    -   `components` - contains repeatable UI components
    -   `containers` - contains high-level UI components (logger, visualizer, etc.)
    -   `constants` - contains fixed values used throughout the application
    -   `store` - contains logic for the application Redux state
    -   `types` - contains all Typescript types
    -   `utils` - contains misc code
-   `.prettierrc` - configuration for autoformating tool
-   `CMakeLists.txt` - cmake build script
-   `common.d.ts` - definition file for file assets
-   `package.json` - specifies dependencies, dev and build scripts.
-   `package.xml` - specifies ros dependencies
-   `tsconfig.json` - configuration file for typescript compiler
-   `tslint.json` - configuration for typescript linter
-   `yarn.lock` - autogenerated lock file for javascript dependencies

## Design notes

### Approach to the application UI layout

The visualizer will consist of multiple page which serve a single purpose. Each page will
be divided into sections as follow:

-   **Main:** Contains the primary focus of the page
-   **Sidebar title:** Contains the page title and additional options specific to the page
-   **Sidebar:** Contains additional controls or information relevant to the current page
-   **Sidebar control:** Contains navigation controls to switch between pages
-   **Footer:** Contains simple breadcrumbs of information relevant to the application as a whole or to the current page

The application's primary layout is defined in [index.html](src/index.html) and styling is
provided by [style.css](src/style.css).

Access to those section in the React application is done via [React Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html).
Portals are used to ensure the application layout is enforced throughout all the pages while offering an
easy way to access them.
