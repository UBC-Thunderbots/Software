| My code completion / IntelliSense isn't working in CLion, but the project seems to be set up correctly and the code is building fine. What's wrong? | Build the project within CLion (rather than with bazel from the command line). You may also need to sync your bazel project. You can either right-click on a folder in CLion and click "partially sync", or click the button in the top-right of CLion with the bazel logo to sync the entire project.|
| It feels like the thing I'm working on should have already been done somewhere. There's **no way** we don't already have a function or class for this already, right? | Ask around the team, especially your lead, if they know of something that already does what you need. If it feels like it should already have been done, it likely has and someone can point to the right place to look. It's better to quickly ask than to duplicate work. |
