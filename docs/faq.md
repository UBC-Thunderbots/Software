| --- | --- |
| My code completion / IntelliSense isn't working in CLion, but the project seems to be set up correctly and the code is building fine. What's wrong? | Build the project within CLion (rather than with catkin from the command line). |
| I'm getting unexpected build failures, even after cleaning and rebuilding the project. | Clean the project again, delete the `build` and `devel` folders at the top of the repository, and rebuild again. The `build` and `devel` folders are part of the build process and can store some information that sometimes causes build problems, especially when doing complicated git operations. |
| It feels like the thing I'm working on should have already been done somewhere. There's **no way** we don't already have a function or class for this already, right? | Ask around the team, especially your lead, if they know of something that already does what you need. If it feels like it should already have been done, it likely has and someone can point to to the right place to look. It's better to quickly ask than to duplicate work. |
| I can't source the setup script / I can't run `source devel/setup.sh` because the file/folder doesn't exist | The `devel` folder likely doesn't exist. This folder is generated when you run `catkin_make`, so simply run `catkin_make` from the `Software` folder (the base of the repo) to generate the folder. Then you should be able to run `source devel/setup.sh` successfully. |
| I'm trying to run a node using `rosrun` but I get an error similar to the following: `[ERROR] [1535424889.095662694]: [registerPublisher] Failed to contact master at [localhost:11311]. Retrying...` | You most likely forgot to run `roscore` first. Open a new terminal, run `roscore`, then try again. |
| I tried to run a node using `rosrun`, but I get the following error: `[rospack] Error: package 'thunderbots' not found` | You most likely forgot to source the `setup.sh` file in your terminal session. Navigate to the `Software` folder, and run `source devel/setup.sh`. The `rosrun` command should now work. |
| I tried to run a launch file using roslaunch, but I get an error similar to the following: `RLException: [ai.launch] is neither a launch file in package [thunderbots] nor is [thunderbots] a launch file name` | You most likely forgot to source the `setup.sh` file in your terminal session. See the solution above. |
| When running CMake in CLion, it fails with an error similar to: `ImportError: No module named catkin.environment_cache` or some other ros or catkin related error | You most likely forgot to source the `setup.sh` file in your terminal before launching CLion. See the solution above for how to source the `setup.sh` file, and the run `clion` from the same terminal.
