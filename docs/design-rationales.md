# Design Rationale

### TODO: Document These Things
* [ ] Namespaces
* [ ] Overall architecture
* [ ] Class Hierarchies
* [ ] Factory design pattern for Play, Primitive, etc.
* [ ] Singleton design pattern for Logger, Drawer, etc.
* [ ] Constants vs. Dynamic parameters (why we have both, where each should be used, etc.)
* [ ] Visualizer -> Ai interfaces (ROS messages, websockets, etc.)
* [ ] Difference between HL components and Navigator components. Be clear about where the separation is, and why. Actiona and Intents are not combined because Actions are part of HL, while Intents are part of Navigator. Combining them would break the abstraction and couple STP to the navigator, removing our flexibility to implement different HL systems in the future
